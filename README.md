# Speech and image recognition systems - University project
# Tree recognition system by leaves

## Introduction

The aim of the project "Tree Species Recognition System Based on Leaf Appearance"
is to create an advanced tool for identifying tree species based on
leaf photo analysis.
The project aims to use image recognition and learning technologies
machine to create a system that can automatically and precisely classify
different tree species based on their leaves. Such a system has the potential to be used in
many fields such as botany, forestry, environmental education and conservation
environment. This can also help monitor and protect diversity
biological, enabling quick and accurate identification of tree species.
Ultimately, the goal is to create a tool that is not only accurate and effective,
but also easy to use for people without specialized botanical knowledge. Thanks to this,
everyone will be able to contribute to the protection and understanding of our natural world.
